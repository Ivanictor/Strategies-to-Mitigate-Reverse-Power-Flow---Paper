# Strategies-to-Mitigate-Reverse-Power-Flow---Paper
This repository contains the datasets of the distribution network used in the study. 
The following files are presented in the repository: 

1. Lines.xlsx: It contains all the segments of line, from substation output (Bus 1) to the loads of the distribution network and their specific parameters. The file also presents the linecodes from each line.
2. Loads.xlsx: It contains all loads of the system, sorted from the highest to the lowest active power. The top 45 loads with highest power are placed in the selected buses to implement the proposed strategies.
3. Transformers.xlsx: It contains all transformers of the grid and their parameters. The nominal voltages specified for primary and secondary windings are both line-to-line voltages.
4. Linecodes.xlsx: "Linecodes" correspond to the line arrangements in the study. By dividing the resistances, reactances, and susceptances by the line lengths, their per-unit-length values are obtained, which are standardized for each arrangement (linecode). This file presents the linecodes and their parameters.
